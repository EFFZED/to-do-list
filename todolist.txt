Todo List

"""
Let’s start with the good-old trusty todo list, the “Hello, World” of full programs. 
You’re going to write a command-line todo list program that meets the following specifications:
"""

    1. Prompt the user to enter a chore or task.
    2. Allow the user to enter as many tasks as desired but stop entering tasks by entering a blank task. 
       Do not store the blank task.
    3. Display all the tasks.
    4. Allow the user to remove a task, to signify it’s been completed.

"""
Bonus: Persist all chores so that when the command line app is restarted, all the chores are still there. 
       Use Redis for ultimate test. We judge based on UX and code quality. (Please note this is a terminal app.)
